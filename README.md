## Amazon Best Seller Analysis  

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to explore Amazon book listings and customer reviews to analyze sales trends, reader preferences and review patterns. 


**Problem Statement & Data Introduction** 

I am aiming to identify key factors that influence book popularity and ratings, addressing questions such as:

- What genres, authors, or price ranges are most popular among readers?

- How do book length, publication year, and pricing correlate with ratings?

- Are there trends in book sales (e.g., seasonal spikes, bestseller traits)?
